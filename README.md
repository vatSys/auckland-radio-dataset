# VATNZ vatSys Dataset Project

[![Currently Released AIRAC](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currently%20Released%20AIRAC-In%20Beta%20Testing-blue)](https://github.com/vatnz-dev/new-zealand-dataset)

The VATNZ vatSys Dataset project is an open source collaborative project allowing members of the VATNZ community to work together to create a high-quality dataset to use in vatSys.

A new sector file will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle (as long as significant changes warrant such as release). 

## Releases

A **major dataset update** will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle, as long as there are significant enough changes to the NZAIP that warrants such a release. A **major dataset release** will follow the traditional 21xx format, with the first release of an AIRAC cycle being **Revision A** (ie 2101 Rev A)

A **minor dataset update** will be released between each AIRAC cycle, allowing for emergency fixes that cannot be held back until a major dataset release. This may include airspace updates, or minor configuration changes. Each subsequent dataset release will incrementally increase the revision letter.

VatSys allows for the remote updating of the vatSys dataset from the GitHub repository. This can only be done by a member of the VATNZ Board of Directors, or a delegated individual. As such, instructions for releasing a new Revision is not public.

A changelog is maintained [and provided here](.github/CHANGELOG.md). Update notifications are also posted in the #vatsys-discussion channel in the VATNZ Discord server.

## Contributing

A contribution guide has been written and is available in [./github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). All members who wish to make contributions to the Dataset are to adhere to these guidelines, otherwise their changes may be revoked.
